# LPSjl

Bayesian Networks Order-based Search changes the paradigm of Bayesian Networks Structure Learning, by looking into the spacing of nodes parents, which demands a time-complexity of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{grey}O(n^k)"> for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{grey}n"> variables, in spite of the traditional Networks Structure space which is a NP-hard problem with superexponential, i.e., <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{grey}O(n!2^\binom{n}{2})">, time complexity. 

Given the great performance obtained by the Julia Language, seems a natural choice to use it for Bayesian Networks Structure Learning, and in conjunction with [BayesNets.jl](https://sisl.github.io/BayesNets.jl/dev/index.html) improve Julia support for Bayesian Networks-related research.

## Bayesian Networks Structure Learning

For a more in-depth presentation of the Bayesian Networks Structure Learning problem and the relations to this project, see [our docs](https://vbob.github.io/LPSjl.jl/).

<br/>

## How to Contribute

1. Create a new branch with the functionality code
2. Make your changes
    * Ask for help if needed
3. Create a merge request

New files and folders are encouraged to be created to provide better responsabilities separation and easier exploration of the project.

For now, working code is better than reusable code. Refactoring time will come when all basic functionalities have been implemented.

## To do List

Each of the items in the list have a suggested file where such functionality should be added.


### Data Structures

**DAGs**
- [x] DBN01 - Create structure for storing DAGs (DAG.jl)
    - `Improvement`: Migrate to [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl)

**Probability Tables**
- [x] DBN02 - Create structure for storing Conditional Probability Tables (`CPT.jl`)
    - `Improvement`: Evaluate the performance of current implementation with SparseMatrix and compare to a possible [DataFrames.jl](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) with missing values.

**Bayesian Networks**
- [x] DBN03 - Create structure for storing Bayesian Networks as DAG and CPT pairs
    - `(BayesianNetwork.jl)`: 
        - `Structure: Array{node}`
        - `CPT: DataFrame`
        - `columns(CPT)`: `node.parents`


### Inference
- [ ] DBN04 - Create functions for basic BN inference (`BayesianNetwork.jl`)


### Scoring 
- [ ] DBN05 - Create interface for BN scoring (`BaseScore.jl`)
- [x] DBN05A - Implement AIC, WAIC, BIC and BDEu Scores (`scores/${ScoreName}.jl`)
    - `TODO`: Currently in `staging` directory. Has to be cleaned up and inherit the `BaseScore` model yet to be defined.
    - `Improvement`: Evaluate the usage of [StatsBase.jl](https://juliastats.org/StatsBase.jl/latest/statmodels/) for calculating Bayesian/Akaike Information Criterion (AIC/BIC) for Bayesian networks given the data

### Learning 

**Structure**
- [ ] DBN06 - Create interface for BN structure learning (`BaseStructureLearning.jl`)

**Parameters**
- [ ] DBN07 - Create interface for BN parameters learning (`BaseParameterLearning.jl`)
- [ ] DBN07A - Implement BN parameters learning algorithms (`structureLearning/${Algorithm}.jl`)

### Misc
- [ ] DBN08 - Create notebook with basic use scenario (`examples/basic.ipynb`)
- [ ] DBN AC01 - Set of functions to evaluate consistency through datasets\
        - Stationarity Tests\
        - Markov Condition

**OBS Algorithm**

- [ ] Implement the order-based search algorithm with network in-degree constraints, as proposed by Teyssier & Koller (2012)
- [ ] Implemente the Acyclic Selection Ordering-Based Search (ASOBS), proposed by Scanagatta et al. (2015)

## Future:
* Unit tests
* BN plot and export functions
* BN export functions
* Learn BNs from timestamped data
* Matthews Correlation Coefficient
* Algorithm for combining BNs with MCMC
